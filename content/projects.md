## active projects

### google benchmark
https://github.com/google/benchmark

a library to run microbenchmarks on C++ code, similar to unit tests.

_#benchmark #c++_

### swarm
https://github.com/dominichamon/swarm

swarm is a project that offers a dead simple way to run jobs on a cluster.  run
a worker on every member of the cluster, and swarm will discover those workers
using UDP multicast (for now).  once found, you can run jobs and it will pick
the best worker on which to run the job.

_#go #grpc_

### tcp\_estats-ebpf
https://github.com/dominichamon/tcp\_estats-ebp

an attempt to bring RFC4898 to the linux kernel using eBPF, rather than direct
integration.

_#go #c #ebpf_
