Do you host your site through [dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/ "dreamhost")? If
not, you should.  They’re fantastic and great.

In fact, they just got even more fantastic:
http://blog.dreamhost.com/2010/11/04/mod\_pagespeed-now-available/

If you already use them, you should totally go and turn this feature on.  Go
ahead, I’ll wait here.

To save you reading their blog post: They have enabled
[mod\_pagespeed](http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/module.html "mod_pagespeed")
as an option for domain managers. This module dynamically rewrites pages before
they’re served to make them faster to download and faster to render. Why is this
good? Well if everyone used it, you could browse twice as many sites with
pictures of [puppies](http://cuteoverload.com/), [kittens](http://icanhascheezburger.com/),
or [sugar gliders](http://dailysquee.com/) in the same amount of time.

*Disclaimer*: This is one of the projects I work on.
